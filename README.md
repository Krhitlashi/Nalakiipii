Simulation of the one of my fictional worlds, the Shumekayne. Currently mostly for showing off the designs in 3d. 

## Current Progress / ſɭᴎɔ j͑ʃᴜꞇ ſ͕ɭwȝ ꞁȷ̀ᴜ }ʃꞇ

There are only a few locations as of now.

- Aisiakrhi / ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ j͑ʃꞇᴜ ſɭˬꞇ
  - Buildings / ſןᴜȝ
    - Houses (Kapii (IPA /kapɪ̈/)) / ſɭᴜ ſןɹ - Enterable. Somewhat pyramidal buildings usually colored green and yellow. Mostly used as housing, although can also be used for other purposes too except it would be colored differently.
    - Kacheq (IPA /kaçɛŋ/) / ſɭᴜ ſ͔ɭɔȝ - Enterable. Similar structure to a *kapii*, although uses more wood like colors. Used as a eating place.
    - Paq Wookii (IPA /paŋ ʋəkɪ̈/) / ſןᴜȝ ᶅſw ſɭɹ - Not enterable. Mainly used for work and designed mostly for show. 
  - *Chiirhchii / ſ͔ɭɹƴ ſ͔ɭɹ* - main planet of Aisiakrhi located outside of the Shumekayne. The main starting point is south in a very cold area.
    - Main city - Boring.
    - Artificial ground height decreasing per interval thing used to grow certain plants.

- Space - Not very functional. Its teleport screen only includes Chiirhchii and Siqchii.
  - Spaceship - Enterable. Iikrhian design.

## Current Plans / ſɭᴎɔ j͑ʃᴜꞇ ʃэ ſ̀ȷᴜ ſɭᴜꞇ }ʃꞇ

- Expand Aisiakrhi.
- Work on and fix Space.

### Not in Aisiakrhi

- Work on Isawat buildings based on concept drawing.
  - Work on Isawat language
- Add Lmən area
- Plan Omo architecture staring in Idoboih city. Due to the diversity within the Omo and Jantə (Main planet for them, shared with Hubadhu) in general, this will be broken into parts.
